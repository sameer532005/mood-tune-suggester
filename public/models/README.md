# Face Detection Models

This application uses face-api.js for facial expression detection.

The models are loaded directly from the CDN at https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/models instead of local files to ensure reliable loading.

This helps avoid issues with model loading paths and ensures the application works smoothly in various environments.
